# KiTS-Dataset---CT-Scan-Segmentation-Preprocessing
KiTS Dataset - CT Scan Segmentation &amp; Preprocessing
This project provides a complete pipeline for processing and visualizing the KiTS (Kidney Tumor Segmentation) dataset. It includes CT scan preprocessing, segmentation mask alignment, orientation correction, slice-level PNG export, and train-validation-test splittingâ€”ultimately preparing data for deep learning applications in kidney/tumor segmentation.
ðŸ“Š Features
âœ… Loads and processes 3D CT and segmentation NIfTI files

âœ… Automatically reorients data to RAS+ canonical orientation

âœ… Applies Hounsfield windowing for kidney-optimized view

âœ… Converts axial slices into PNG images and masks

âœ… Supports overlays with contour plots of segmented areas

âœ… Splits data into Train / Validation / Test (customizable)

âœ… Saves metadata and integrity verification plots
ðŸ“Š Dataset Visualization
Orientation previews for kidney vs tumor per window (kidney, lung, soft tissue)

Distribution of slices per patient

Class distribution across slices using boxplots

Sample overlays and contour maps for inspection

âœ… Verification
Each split is automatically verified:

Ensures masks and images are aligned

Confirms segmentation is present

Overlays are drawn and saved as visual debugging tools

ðŸ“Œ Notes
This script handles NIfTI to PNG preprocessing and segmentation mask overlay for semantic segmentation models.

The segmentation mask values are scaled to:

0: background

127: kidney

254: tumor
